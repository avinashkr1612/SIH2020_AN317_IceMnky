> # INDIA TOUR GUIDE ALEXA SKILL
> Alexa is Amazonâ€™s cloud base voice service, that helps users interact with brands, data, and business logic through voice. Use Alexa to innovate, and build the next generation of interfaces for tourists in India. Your solution should help solve pain points of tourists coming to India like - 
voice forums to crowd source destination reviews, 
GPS based voice navigators to guide tourists at historical sites,
 SOS and emergency support solutions for local and international travelers,
 travel guides with entry prerequisites, government policies, visa needs, and recommendations on seasons to visit.
 
The Alexa based solution should be intuitive to use also cater to the physically challenged travelers in India.
1. We intend to make a forum to store various destination reviews, their GPS coordinates, entry prerequisites, policies, visa needs, recommendations for differently-abled citizens and much more information into the database, This database can be accessed through an API by Alexa endpoint.

2. Our system will feed a description of most of the monument/landmark  within the historical site along with its GPS coordinates, so when tourist resides within that coordinate (or within 10 meter) may directly ask our skill to describe that monument/landmark of that historical site.

3. (This feature from the skill will work mostly for devices with inbuilt GPS support like Mobile devices. Stationary devices like the Amazon Echo do not provide geo-coordinate data through location services).

4. For emergency support & SOS features, whenever any tourist requires any emergency support the skill will send alert messages along with his/her GPS coordinates by SMS, Phone calls and email to pre-set contacts asking for help.

5. The skill would keep statics about the number of users referring to the historical site  along with user detail.
